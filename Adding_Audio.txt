Adding audio is a tricky thing to do. You can do it via the cheap method (USB sound card) or the expensive method (cirrus logic audio card)

Cirrus cards are really expensive. So the safer way would be buying a cheap USB sound card. 

<<<Few Tutorials>>>

1) Adding an usb mic. https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-set-up-a-microphone-on-Raspberry-pi-And-how-to-get-an-input-from-it


2) Second one: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/43320/raspberry-pi-3-audio-input


3) A project I found on kickstarter

   > http://www.audioinjector.net/#!/rpi-hat


4) Another alternative. This uses a cheap USB sound card and a software from GitHub.
   >Link to the software: http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation/

   Read the documentation and installation giude. (It's a lil complicated)
